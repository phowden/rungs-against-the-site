# Lotus’ Lament
Decided will be the fate of the land
When this hepate of signs is near at hand.
In the house of Zinlun the wizard born
Through life, unlife, he will Earthfall scorn.
The drowned one-eyed, to the key he will point
To unlock where here, shapers’ and dark world are joined
Island temples of old, where true prophecies were once told,
The Heir shall gain the Aspect TriFold, allowing time to unfold.
The half-blood child of stern mother found
Unravel the first domain of those which are bound.
Returns land forlorn to the Maker’s vale
Crushing Melaenis’ followers without fail
To another eye, the tower ascends
Wyrms at the bottom, wyrms at the end
A ring both foreign and familiar, to be destroyed
Before victory can be won and peace be enjoyed.
