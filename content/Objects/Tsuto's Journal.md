## [[Tsuto Kaijitsu|Tsuto]]'s Handwriting

### 4701
Having a journal would help, he said. Oh, how I hate this town and its prejudiced folks, [[Headmaster Gandethus]] most of them! But I guess he's right: Striking the only person who's been good to me and comes to visit me in the Academy, was probably not the smartest move. But [[Ameiko]] will come around. She always does. 
### Still 4701 
Apparently a journal needs to have dates in it. Well, [[Headmaster Gandethus|Gandethus]] didn't say how specific that needs to be. [[Ameiko]] has not visited me since we quarreled and today I learned that she has left [[Sandpoint]] with a group of adventurers who passed through. I can't believe that she abandoned me. I feel so lonely. 

### 4702 
She's dead… The bastard [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu|Lonjiku]] didn't let my mother see me anyways, so I can't say that much has changed, but I am sure it wasn't [[Chopper]] who killed [[Atsuii Kaijitsu|Atsuii]]. Ever since my “arrival” I was a constant reminder of my mother's betrayal of [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu|Lonjiku]]. Given that she was found at the bottom of the cliff next to their mansion and still had her eyes and tongue, I am certain that [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu|Lonjiku]] pushed her off that cliff. At least the Headmaster convinced [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu|Lonjiku]] to let me attend her funeral. I have also heard that [[Ameiko]] is back in town for it and asked her father to let me attend. She has a good heart and surely - - now that she has been traveling – she sees how messed up this place is. After the funeral I am out of here!!! That friggin geezer almost broke my jaw with his cane and nobody stopped him! And even [[Ameiko]] was against me. But I was right, I could see it in his eyes, when I confronted him at the funeral: He killed my mother! He pushed her off the cliff! Tomorrow, I will make my way down to [[Magnimar]]. I have heard that they don't hate people there just because they have pointed ears. Just thinking about how everybody at the funeral was staring at me after [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu|Lonjiku]] hit me, makes my blood boil. As if it was my fault! 

### 4703 - [[Magnimar]] 
Well, well, well, who would have thought that [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu|Lonjiku]]'s hypocrisy is so limitless. Today I finally got around to look at the [[Kaijitsu Family|Kaijitsu]] Manor in the Naos district. That's where the liar stays on his frequent trips to the city. Charming one of the guards and chatting her up was well worth my time. Looks like L was not just haggling prices of glass wares down there but that [[Ameiko]] has another half-sibling. This one however sprung from an affair of L with a Chelish noble woman. Sounded like this long-lost member of the [[Kaijitsu Family|Kaijitsu]] family lives in Westcrown, probably went back home with her mother. I should visit her someday! For now I will focus on finding more of those dirty secrets L tries to hide.
### 4704 - [[Magnimar]]
A nightly raid of the manor yielded some interesting facts, although much is still shrouded in mystery. Apparently, there was a small fleet which brought the original Kajitsus over from [[Minkai]]. Wonder where those ships are… 

### 4705 - [[Magnimar]] 
Turns out that sneaking out of the Academy at night and fighting off the bullies with my bare hands gave me some valuable experience which is in much demand in [[Magnimar]]. Being silent and deadly pays well! 
### 4706 - [[Magnimar]] 
I have to find something else. Didn't think that the [[Sczarni]] would go to that length to bring me into their fold. I was able to escape, but this was a close call. I think it's time to lay low and go back to finding some more of L's secrets. Done right, I should be able to squeeze a good amount of gold out of him for my silence. 

### 4707 - [[Magnimar]] 
Ha, what a coincidence. To escape the [[Sczarni]], I had to duck into one of those shops at the Bazaar of Sails. And what do I find: A ship name tag which reads “Kajitsu Star”, the name of one of the Kajitsu fleet's ships. It took a few days to find the ranger who sold it to the shop. She did not volunteer her name, but disclosed that she took it from a ship wreck she found in the [[Brinestump Marsh]] up North. Thought it would up the prices of some of the [[Minkai]] junk she pried out of the wreck. Guess, I am going to leave the comfort of the city for a while. Might also help to shake off those [[Sczarni]]… 

### 4707 – [[Brinestump Marsh]] 
What an awful place. [[Goblin]]'s, insects and reptiles everywhere and I have to sleep in the open. It's not as romantic as some bards tell you it is. But I found the wreck and tomorrow I am going to explore it. Today there was a goblin poking around. Scuttled off with what looked like parchment and some fireworks? The parchment might be worth going after if I don't find the documents I am looking for. 
### 4707 – [[Goblin]]'s Lair 
Well, that didn't go well. Mental note to self: Never underestimate these little buggers. I know a thing or two about sneaking up on somebody, but them being so little, they got the better of me. Two days I spent bound and with a smelly sack over my head, while they dragged me to who-knows-where. I can hear waves breaking, so we still must be close to the coast. They threw me into a cell and told me that the “Chief” will decide tomorrow if I die. Weird, that they took everything from me except this journal, ink and quill. 
## Different Handwriting
### 4070 – My love's home 
Fair to say that their Chief is not what I expected. Rarely have I laid eyes on such a beauty and I am afraid my heart is lost. What started out as a rude interrogation took a turn when I mentioned that [[Ameiko]] would probably pay a handsome ransom for me. There is definitely no love lost for [[Sandpoint]] with that Chief and in a few quick hours I turned from a prisoner to a valuable advisor and how to erase that presumptuous pustule of a settlement from the map in the most painful way. 

Unbelievable, that her teacher lives now for thousands of years directly under [[Sandpoint]]. She thinks she has long passed her in knowledge, but she still goes back from time to time to have a look. Tomorrow I am to travel back to [[Brinestump Marsh]] to recruit the local tribe there for the upcoming raid on [[Sandpoint]]. Not sure if my goblin guard is really there to protect me or to ensure that I don't bolt. In any case, having found the love of my life, just the prospect of seeing her face again is sufficient motivation to return to her side. 
### 4707 – [[Lost Coast]] Road 
Success! The [[Licktoad Tribe]] tribe is on board. Bruthazmus might be a reeking pile of muscles, but he for sure knows how to bribe a goblin chief. In two days we will be ruining their pretty festival!
