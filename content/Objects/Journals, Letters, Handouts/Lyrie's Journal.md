Journal discovered in the bandit hideout under [[Thistletop]]. Written by [[Lyrie]].
# Transcript
## 14 Calistril
We have arrived. My, this place is a mess! These [[Goblin|Goblins]] have no notion of organization. We have set up in the underground level. Judging by the stonework, no [[Goblin|Goblins]] escavated this. Who, then?
## 22 Calistril
We finished exploring the complex. They have a tentamort here, which proved amusing to study for a few days.

Further inspection of the architecture leads me to believe that this was built about 500 years ago. Also answered my earlier question of who - they were cultists of [[Lamashtu]]. No wonder they wanted an underground lair.

Tomorrow we start digging up the entrance to the rooms below. [[Nualia]] is certain they are there.
## 28 Calistril
They're still digging. I'm bored. I found out all I could about those cultists, who seem to have met an untimely end, judging by the skeletons. Spent a pleasant morning with [[Tsuto]] while [[Nualia]] was supervising the dig operations. He's quite a handsome fellow, shame he only has eyes for the asimaar. And I think [[Orik]] is oggling me, ugh! Will amuse myself in the afternoon by sketching the island.

## 6 Pharast
Ugh, what a mess. [[Jagen]] is dead. [[Nualia]] burned his remains as sacrifice to [[Lamashtu]] - whatever was left after the trap had its way with him. We'll have to be very careful from now on. The good news is that the lowest level is now accessible. The bad news is that the entrance doors were smashed by the stupid cultists, so there isn't much left to study there. 

The statues likely represent the local ruler. Maybe even one of the [[Runelord|Runelords]]? If so, will have to figure out which one.

In any case, the lowest level is much, much older than the rest of the complex. By all signs, those rooms date from the time of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] empire. What a find!
## 14 Gozran
Well, I've certainly been busy! So many items, fragments and inscriptions to study and catalogue! Judging by the construction techniques used and the type of structural reinforcement elements, I think this used to be part of a much larger construction, maybe a statue of colossal size.

If my theory is correct, the scale would be staggering. But that's [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] for you! They never did anything half-measure. Still have to figure out the purpose of it all, so far it has eluded me. A watch tower? [[Nualia]] speaks of the creature imprisoned here, so maybe it was a jail? However, some of the carvings seem to indicate a collection point function as well.
## 3 Desnus
Still busy. We have explored most of the level, although [[Nualia]] believes there are more rooms.
## 20 Gozran
The seven-pointed star is a common symbol in the complex. Which is very curious, as it is almost identical with the medallion that [[Nualia]] wears. I asked her about it, but she got cagey and told me to mind my own business. 

Well, this Is my business - this research is why you hired me. Stupid cow.
We're starting to have more frequent planning sessions now. The date of the raid has been set.
## 23 of Rova - the autumn equinox
[[Tsuto]] says he has a plan to get the [[Goblin|Goblins]] into town without them being detected. Apparently he grew up in this backwater and knows it quite well. He was entirely too smug about something and kept dropping hints about his connections. He's so hot when he plots mayhem!
## 9 Sarenith
These inscriptions are fascinating! I have been cross-referencing them with findings from other sites and they hint at extraordinary things. Hah, I'd like to see the faces of the [[Pathfinder Society]] when I publish my research! I bet they will be sorry that they rejected my application. Stuck up idiots. So what if I killed my rivals?

Anyway, this bit here:

I mean, I COULD be wrong, but this seems to hint that they had, or were close to discovering the means to immortality! Although that makes me wonder where ARE they, if this is true... Did they depart for another world, like the Elves did so long ago? Very mysterious.
## 26 Arodus
Less than a month until [[Nualia]] sets her plans in motion. I don't much care about whatever grudge she has for the town, but she promised that she'll let me study the ruins under [[Sandpoint]]. Apparently there is another [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] site, right under the peasants' nose!

[[Tsuto]] has been spending more and more time away from [[Thistletop]] and doing gods know what in town. The others are either dull or irritating. The [[Goblin|Goblins]] are increasingly on edge.

I would be bored to death without my research.
## 24 Rova
Well, they did it! The [[Goblin|Goblins]] brought back that priest's remains, [[Nualia]]'s adoptive father. She burned them in the chapel as a sacrifice. Then [[Lamashtu]] "rewarded" her by transforming her left arm into a hideous fiend claw.

I really do not understand this woman. I would KILL to look like her, especially considering how much [[Tsuto]] is drooling after her, but she thinks her angelic blood is a curse to be rid of. So stupid.
## 27 Rova
[[Tsuto]] hasn't returned yet. I am starting to get worried. He should have been back by now, to plan the next step. I hope he's not hurt. Or worse. I really don't want to think about it.
