## 17th of Kuthona, 1822
Today is my birthday and I am now six years old. [[Màthair]] gave me
this djornail as a presend. So that I can practice the writing she
~~teached~~ taut me over the past year. Athair allowed [[Gilan ApBlanc|Gilan]], [[Morholt]]
and [[Petitcrieu]] to play with me in the great hall the whole afternoon.
This time I almost ~~catched~~ caut [[Gilan ApBlanc|Gilan]]’s little doggie. When I turn
ate I want a puppy too! After we ate dinnear athair goed to his
room. Same as last night. Same as every night. [[Màthair]] told us once
that [[Athair]] plays the lute very well. Yes! I heard one of the
villagers calling him the young minstrel. I wish he would play for us
one day. Before he married [[Màthair]] he was holding merry feasts in
the big hall. But after the wedding he no longer aintertined. Maybe
that is why [[Màthair]] is always so sad.
## 5th of Pharast, 1824
I still do not have a dog. But with all the chores [[Màthair]] gives me
I would have no time to play with him anyways. All this reading! But
today something exciting happened: Mom gave me a book to read on
my own which I have never seen before, and it is our secret! It is
about a god of old, [[Diancecht]], who cares about healing. There is a
symbol of him in the book which looks a lot like the amulet [[Màthair]]
carries around her neck: a crossed acorn and mistletoe. I tried some
of the incantations on a hurt animal I found in the woods and it
mended the broken bone!
## 12th of Gozran, 1825
I feel the days when [[Athair]]’s men pull out all the new trees after
the snow has melted, are the hardest for [[Màthair]]. She is so much
sadder. Almost as sad as the day when [[Athair]] found out about our
secret and took [[Diancecht]]’s book away from me. I have never seen
him so angry. [[Gilan ApBlanc|Gilan]] has [[Petitcrieu]] and even on his eleventh birthday
last week didn’t want to do anything but play with him. [[Morholt]] is
too busy pleasing either [[Màthair]]’s piety or [[Athair]]’s fascination with
swords and such. Nobody cares about me and now with the book
gone, I am back to being bored.
## 21st of Rova, 1826
He is dead. Torn to pieces by [[Athair]]’s wolves. I hope that by writing
this I can get the horror out of me. I was at the window, watching
the servs setting up in the courtyard for the last day of summer
fest, when [[Petitcrieu]] darted out of the stables, a pack of [[Athair]]’s
wolves on his heels. With his stubby legs he was easy prey for them.
But what happened next, will be forever burned into my memory:
Trying to save his beloved pet, [[Gilan ApBlanc|Gilan]] ran at the wolves.
Immediately, they turned on him. [[Athair]] came running out of the
stables, shouting at the wolves to leave [[Gilan ApBlanc|Gilan]] be. But to no avail, it
needed him to wade him and drive the wolves off with his sword.
Some of them still carried pieces of [[Gilan ApBlanc|Gilan]] in their slavering jaws.
There is little left of him to bury. Summer has ended, the autumn
rain has started to fall. I turn to the memories of [[Diancecht]]’s book.
[[Athair]] took the book away, but its pages never left my mind.
## 2nd of Neth, 1830
I am worried about [[Morholt]]. He tries so hard to please both of our
parents and is often caught in the crossfire between their thinly
veiled barbs at each other. Luckily, with 15 he is old enough to lead
the servs on their supply trips to the village and I can go with him.
A welcomed escape for both of us. It was on today’s trip that he
encountered someone who might change his life: [[Duncan ApDuguid]], a
priest of [[Morrigan]], the goddess of war. I haven’t seen [[Morholt]] so
excited since he got his first real sword. He even bought me the
leather cloak I had been eyeing for some time. He went on and on on
the way back how following [[Morrigan]] would please both [[Màthair]] and
[[Athair]]: He could follow one of the old gods and become an
accomplished warrior at the same time.
## 19th of Abadius, 1833
Today is the day [[Morholt]] has been looking forward to for a long
time. He has followed the teachings of [[Morrigan]] diligently since that
fateful day in three years ago. I suspect he trains so hard because
he is looking forward to war taking him away from this bleak place
and our bickering parents. He even got the crossed swords of
[[Morrigan]] tattooed over his heart! My studies of [[Diancecht]] are
progressing as well, although not as quickly as [[Morholt]]’s as I have
to keep them a secret from [[Athair]]. My powers have grown and I
have started trying to drive away the ghosts which roam the halls
of the keep at night. With mixed success. But I digress: Today is
the day [[Morholt]]’s mentor, [[Duncan ApDuguid]], is visiting [[Keep
ApBlanc]], to spend an evening of discourse with us.
## 20th of Abadius, 1833
Now it’s only me. Another tragedy sought out our family and took
[[Morholt]] from us. He was only 18 years of age. And to think that he
gave [[Duncan ApDuguid|Duncan]] his own more comfortable bed as a sign of hospitality,
only to be murdered by him in his sleep. [[Duncan ApDuguid|Duncan]] cleaved the whole bed
in two and [[Morholt]]’s entrails were all over the floor. I can only
imagine how cold-blooded this [[Duncan ApDuguid|Duncan]] must be as he went back to his
room, just dropped the bloody sword next to his bed and fell asleep.
That is where [[Bonnie]], [[Màthair]]’s most trusted maid, found him,
when [[Athair]] ask her to wake [[Morholt]] to break fast. [[Athair]] tried to
have his men slap [[Duncan ApDuguid|Duncan]] into iron and haul him off to the dungeons,
but a priest of [[Morrigan]] is not easily restrained. He struck down
several guards and never returned.
## 22nd of Abadius, 1833
Wanting to bid my private farewell to [[Morholt]], I slipped into the
hall where he was prepared for the burial. I set out after the sun
had set so that I wouldn’t run into [[Athair]]. But the hall wasn’t
empty despite the late hour: [[Bonnie]] and [[Màthair]] were bend over
[[Morholt]]’s body and something caught the flickering light of the
lamps between them. [[Bonnie]] held what looked like a small piece of
metal, almost like a shard of a sword blade. A meaningful glance was
exchanged between the two women.
## 24th of Abadius, 1833
Death seems to have become a steady guest in this keep. This
morning [[Bonnie]] was found at the bottom of one of the round towers
of the keep, apparently leaped from an upper window, killing herself.
[[Màthair]] wept bitter tears, having lost her closest confidant.
## 1st of Arodus, 1838
Tonight, I made progress with the ghosts of the keep. I was able
to corner one male ghost who has eluded me so far. Conjuring down
[[Diancecht]]’s blessing of healing I was able to touch the ghost who
promptly contorted as if in pain and disappeared. I hope I put him
to rest. My hand is still shaking as I am writing this mere moments
after the encounter. I have taken to carry my journal with me in a
hidden pocket in my favorite cloak to keep it on me at all times. It
seems the safest way to keep it from unwanted prying eyes.
## 2nd of Arodus, 1838
I hope that I can read my writing someday as I am writing this in
complete darkness. Maybe I should have seen it coming, but it still
comes as a shock to me that main own [[Athair]] throws me into a
lightless cell. Which also seem to hold hardly any air. Again, he was so
furious, shouting that he will only let me out if I swear off following
any of the old gods. [[Diancecht]], help me to find a merciful death down
here.
## Date unknown
It becomes hard to track time without the sun and the moon to
track the passing of days. But judging by the growth of my hair a
year might have passed. Maybe the almost complete lack of food and
water makes me see things, but I had a visitor. In the darkness I
was only able to see its outline which is barely illumined by a swirling
eye of a storm on it chest. It doesn’t speak but gently touches my
mind when it lets the cards dance along his fingers. For sure
[[Diancecht]] has answered my prayers. I understand that the
creature has come to “**set things right**” and “**restore what cannot
been disrupted**”. It has conveyed that it has means to whisk me
away from this prison and it’s waiting for the right moment in time
to do so. And while we wait, we play. Makes time fly.

The game has ended

all the cards in their places

still, I am alone.
