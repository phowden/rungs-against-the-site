# Summary
The fate of the land will be decided when 7 signs are shown.

Some descendent of the wizard Zinlun (or Zinlun themselves) will survive [[Earthfall]] through necromancy.

The "drowned one-eyed" will point to a key that unlocks a location where two locations/worlds/realms are joined: "shapers" and "dark world."

Somewhere in [[Iblydos]] ([[Aelyosos]]?) the "heir" will gain the "Aspect TriFold" and allow time to move forward.
