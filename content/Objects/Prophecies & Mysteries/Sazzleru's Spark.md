# Analysis
- "When the home of the living god is completed"
	- Living god? Is this a title of a god we should know?
	- Home == Temple?
- "When the son kills his mother without soul"
	- Does "without soul" mean:
		- The **act of killing** was done without soul, or,
		- The ***mother*** is without soul?
	- What son? What mother?
		- Known son/mother combination [[W_rm|Worm]] + possibly([[Isolt ApBlanc]])?
- "When lord flees home to become king in his own name"
- "Sazzleru’s spark shall be reborn"
	- Have we ever heard of this name?
	- Spark? Lightning?

When a temple to a certain god is finished, a son kills a mother, and a lord declares himself a king... Something will happen...
