[[Yog-Sothoth|The Lurker at the Threshold]] formed the second anchor of creation.

Between [[Pharasma]] and [[Yog-Sothoth]], all reality would thus become the [[Great Beyond]].

Witnesses from *outside the cycle*.

- [[Yog-Sothoth]] is the outer god of gates/space/time
	- Considered one of the most powerful deities of the [[Great Beyond]]
	- Manifestation of the [[Dimension of Time]] or the [[Dark Tapestry]]
	- Cares little for mortal worship, has no need for it
	- Only cares about a worshipper that would summon him to the [[Material Plane]] or **MATE WITH HIM TO BRING HIS PROGENITOR**
