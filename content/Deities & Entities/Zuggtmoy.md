[[Demon Lord]] of mushrooms (?)

> Fear not for your future for now you must sleep
> In [[Zuggtmoy]]'s Cradle your body shall steep.
> Your flesh a fine banquet of delicate food
> Your gift to the Lady shall nourish the brood.
> What births from your leavings and grows in her nave
> Shall feed from your ruins and fat from your grave. 

â€” A traditional lullaby sung to those in [[Zuggtmoy]]'s Cradle
