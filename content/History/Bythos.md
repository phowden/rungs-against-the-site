The bythos are [[Aeons]], guardians of time and planar travel, related to [[Shyka, the Many]]. They hunt down creatures that abuse planar travel or create tears in time.

They only care about balancing time, to the detriment of other things.

[[W_rm]] has a strange relationship to [[Bythos]], not fully realized.
