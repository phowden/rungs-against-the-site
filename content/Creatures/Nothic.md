Nothics are magic users that transformed into monsters as a result of their reckless pursuit of power.

Nothics are unnatural creatures that serve as minions for more powerful aberrations. Though not particularly intelligent, their uncanny abilities make them valuable tools.

A nothic is a twisted humanoid that stands just under five feet in height. Its skin ranges from grayish-green to red-brown, and jagged spikes jut from its hunched back. The nothic’s most prominent feature is the single huge eye that takes up most of its face, glowing with slowly changing colors. Nothics speak in hoarse, croaking voices. They are prone to fits of insane laughter, but can drop dead silent at a moment’s notice.

Inhuman creatures like aboleths, [beholders](http://thecreaturechronicle.tumblr.com/post/36490249187/beholder), and daelkyr all favor nothics as spies thanks to their ability to divine secrets about their foes at a glance. Nothics live to serve, reveling in their masters’ cruelty. When left to their own devices, nothics seek out petty secrets and arcane lore, using what they learn to inflict callous suffering on innocents for the fun of it. Nothics can survive on any organic matter, but prefer the taste of carrion.
