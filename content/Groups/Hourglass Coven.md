> Sister Slackjaw,
> 	The masters have sent me a vision of the keys to the Eye of Avarice. I drew what I can remember and hope this drags some of the ancient visions of yours to the surface. Maybe you can finally be good for something

> 	(drawing of something that looks like the puzzle pieces)
> 	
> 	We need to get these into the hands of the "heroes" but first we have to find them ourselves! I went through some of the odditiees I have collected during the previous incarnations and included is an [[Alkenstar]] safe box with some odds and ends which seem to match.
> 	
> 	In distrust and contempt, greetings from the past from your superior sister,
> 	Skabatha
