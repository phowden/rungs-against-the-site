# Visions

## [[Lotus]]’ Vision

A pleasant feeling of contentment envelopes [[Lotus]]. A feeling of connectedness spreads around her. There seems to be a spiral with three circles in it, floating in the air. It is being identified as the symbol of [[Korada of the Dream Lotus]], an [[Empyreal Lord]]. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/38cG00JzvyAPIjWToXf6Tfz8oi5_wgILqtTAKOM_aAfoT8ZBTUP6K5TMKJhlLmc7ahCgSTARmnOu5DbWLzDzr3RXgARPg6HsEHZU4HnlAeA_coIq1QKy0Ujdn1AwNQtoQICCDVk__anRPM8eA8wZXQ)

Her mind opens up to a misty lake with lily pads and lotus flowers floating on its surface. One of the lotus flowers opens up and looks with caring eyes up to Lotus. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NIHEC64y2k4CKKpX6C3GCYjbDHuUODJE2ZraIIddzDbR-2dWXGcvLLVbjSufaAmiSiSLofBn6WlqSXXH_stNvDgkcmr2LpAslMcHnlYQZNiy5rcIIqi3p1wSiLDm6ZTxXkn3D-IXeHt0hRv2IlWXRA)

You hear the following words, spoken in a serene voice 
- Thoughts on the past
- Concentration about the presence
- Consideration of the future

The view blurs and when it refocuses you see rolling hills, covered with forests. Slowly coming into focus in front of it: 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-1WpPCi0zvz3pyXrbbjwYMbPkEPk-jEhEn0vZsZdGctWZqrqQq5auIxtyEumOD7-uxa1lsEq9mTgfy84_ipO23CaZm6x1hy9_BmD4y3ghvwKrSn3gHWFP6LpRk1ZsZo4Z1mS1gUfZeUxNWzhAW4LcA)

You see two hands cradling the base of the scales, like this. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/J5OmCWrf__rzyFbhPgu76yOxdcxVvkOQfwkuKaMKEqdt4AfYWJit0TEXbFES36pUKBFKD3QzzX_fwb13g4d3Ni_ykrw9Z-P0u9_f6l-0w1r2XXrxWPaRE6jl0I4SfF9Z21ucADkN8cCBaT0vO17DKw)

All of a sudden the sky darkens and it looks like the very land is violently undulating. The scale comes back into focus: 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/B3PZ6l4GdclnhWLTvw3lOVTJgGmLLQjBjLOCR5kOsAdj33EYkiJQWSkZhniT2Zr67Wn5NBPSm0OljgneJ9vAcRJi9wC12NLUO8OZgywcOpRlnW4qSQwp-XgKfn6L6kZPa1-lGznZhugChsb8LOpYhQ)

The cradling hands move apart and the scale tumbles

The scale and the hands move out of focus and the hands expand into the people they belong to:

On the left you see an elderly woman probably in her late 50s with fiery red hair, she has woven red glass beads shaped like berries of the rowan tree and white feathers into her hair, she wears a brown kilt and leather armor over an off-white blouse, a hooded cloak, knee boots of soft leather and carries a solid oak-wood staff 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/c8cTBgvW9G4ow4896hOcErIEZ_aXf22X1uu2W2pQ1UAwJCTZYsudeJ9KyGjaLB7OrZsOF3eCogovYiOQbxyZw9l9oD5kRS9co1LdkoqpXsJzmMWuJU1EDUpgLwKh3PP-b56DDTGpNzj5SWbFYSI4Kw)

On the right you see a woman in her late 20s, brilliant carrot-orange hair, wide shoulders and large callused hands, Brown kilt which is decorated with cloth patches cut in the shape of oak leaves, in colors of red, yellow and orange, beige blouse, knee socks and low soft-leather boots 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/r4Sh17P0sk4JpWXc79r8EwK4bbq3o2mDdggHwUtLiYXJUJQG0uvGvRnj4cb7O8AlAtLnUM7Dqvt-W74PRwAJDbaEC7k3DOsncBQRQQCkBNXaZa98FBfdt-lheNlotz-Z3wtlYEmUrrxBNtHut4vqwA)

The two stare at each other in opposition, but not in hate. The view zooms out and you see an elderly, regal man standing behind them, his face furrowed in concern. He wears the same brown kilt and a torq which Lotus recognizes as a symbol of druidic leadership. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/szJRzZ0Fm9Qqx3mCBdxv9CgTWsqu0VwbftKNtRd6k_R35nVl2ndT0MuYvuDV42rb5NpO82hcjMDzw9AK60gYGiDRSHXy-5lGi9SIJ6JZ1lzbfU0hX7f3pCnAczFCFyRb3YuZdtTSEQJOHiC0VPf0gw)

That concern quickly turns to desperation as the forest behind him starts to disappear and the scale further tips. The vision blurs as the focus seems to swipe across the treeless land and onto a mountain top The older man seems to have shaved his hair, which is often done leading up to important druidic rituals. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/p9yNHhjlOmKZm7P9z0tyl4g48kG2xKBeSSXvJIDog1RiGbdXFwXMjyhKpkQv4ehMfDyPdwL2oQPtImOMuEzOSi1Eff8DI8FjkTsQNle08jpqyYtnGQGBze3Sg8QYzN-rQhiQ6IBDzMKwydcpm6xDOw)

He draws a dagger, takes a deep breath, looks upward and onward and – draws it across his own throat. An expression of hopeful expectation crosses his face before he slumps to the ground. It feels like your vantage point shifts to the man’s eyes and here’s what you see. Then everything turns dark and returns to the vision of the peaceful lake. The vision of [[Korada of the Dream Lotus|Korada]]’s Circle coalesces in an amulet, which floats in the room

## [[W_rm]]'s Vision

Start with what is being identified as the universal symbol for the [[Three Fundamental Truths]] of the multiverse

- The [[Rule of Three]]
	- Everything occurs in threes
- [[Unity of Rings]]
	- Things are circular, happen in rings, connect back to themselves
- [[Center of All]]
	- states that there is a center of everything — or, rather, wherever a person happens to be is the center of the multiverse 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jp_017mnVBAjSXgOxbFhwUkY1auKsGfpxSqN_cwbYPRrdpzrD7OH2TKwL7ZLuYZhCa_VKpzwF--C9zDe5w0aXvki5O1F-J0P5rQHmekSnKtg5IaW6UcgFz4uqxO_jTz42DbcFIl1UGXm-2iar1otng)

After that a series of images flash by. The first one being a coven of [[Hag|Hags]]. It is remembered that when hags team in [[Coven|Covens]], they can access much more powerful magic then each of them individually. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7X9sgg3eQx1qSb5UkFC5k8RrPdMr_Yt_y6vvG_zj10mghLkjeWM5YhasmAnHCSWydOCXc2W3P9NtWJEBN8EAfjsXsgwKYIqLndH2xfYnKTSbkYCFFoVQOlCw99vCIxlfOz0UXkNX-nvlzaa6HPZIxA)

Planar knowledge yields that the below is a planar githzerai sage which goes by the name [[Rule-of-Three]]. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iLf4_Cj_DzyxP8s3OyZXe-3BprzyeGNAkHj4SOiXec-BU4_bzcf_tm0ZlwS0TuNzHb33lp4cXspyAV04kZHnlyVmwYcwRR4zBsj1JbJFUdSvE9jgs_js8gCqH7DCXsEl77osZwzQlRb_Y9DNffID7w)

Consulting your knowledge on the visual below, you got nothing besides that the three statues depict the three stages of womanhood: [[Maiden, Mother, Crone]]. These statues seem to be immense, almost a mile high. In the front several figures are silhouetted, but the outlines shift and details can be discerned. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YiRMFic1c-8gbvhl-WAHb84ifoF5KP9mIBfeKHP2uFPu0oYd1Q-CpzqlkKpNL0SpbaLDdK4Z8jEyyv2bZuMrrgPCcDUqse3_hNjUHRJONIwdvzCC-k2dKNZYiu2eGNDRlzVOloWLlBtVSx7lFgimIA)

This visual is a representation of several blueprints of castles which quickly flash by. The common thread is that all these castles seem to have been built in three stages. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Wbi6UGpyl_rsKP1N5x_DBh8YI1nkjkMQcPXyHfj7lpLDcZTUSwbysTlcGXg0xrfDo7nWYN7-FCTDxoDL_Sj94IwdCQrzBNGP9gRYSu07hjaJs2gQZbHzaxxzZOsjrEddBczoKGCYTb0_zq9EBp75CQ)

Eventually the castle-mania settles on this aerial view of a familiar looking castle. With a bit of concentration you recognise it as being similar to the castle at which the funeral procession ended when you were witnessing in a vision at [[Isolt ApBlanc]]'s grave in the [[Magical Marsh]]. It fills [[W_rm|Wurm]] with a sense of home and belonging. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/E5eSF1hVHXClbIC2150aILHBvJKP74uSZkfJgQLkdKVdkRvfUDXxwo3LMoX28mExZkQkf-V2ZjLLo-_58cMNEez7JlXV_WoRGFyzrI4-faKFxHC5HM44uXqSLKZyoNASIKnMDBAYD5458KqmGpPPfA)

Wurms vision and with the following image, which he recognizes as a depiction of [[Shyka, The Many]], an [[Eldest]]. She appears to be crying, which is unusual. She is being held against her will.

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2--NBRkotl5ncFk2CopMx8JwTTRPYckv-oDfI-4tO0iLH4wMMHkAFFUzeNqBZpbnGVhjIFF9F1CGZ38KkIWiTodpiV81Pw6IxnSWDrmzckOMkAoNlOIGVdKTohfbGT93odEAixIx9ZqMwbFG0eR_2g)

## [[Skar]]'s Vision

It brings him back to THAT day back at the clan, facing the thane. [[Skar]] sees himself and the seething clan chef, but also sees how a book flies in the thane’s face, dropping to the ground. 

It cracks open to the page below. Looks like a page of the [[Song of the Valkyries|Darra Tharlioth]] ([[Song of the Valkyries]]), which is considered the ultimate source on the core virtues of a true Ulfen warrior. [[Skar]] realizes that he is not looking at one of the many copies, but at the original [[Song of the Valkyries|Darra Tharlioth]]. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Awzkxv4163bu2AWeWnYtH-kvCG54YtyZwldTIxVOI5y5rZC7daKni1ELxT88wVmy81VzJmvrNlncnIoePgsP6qCf69R8psE2OVmHf4GMa_Kq553oLmIKqq4EgGfXs9ZoI_udAI9C17li1Y7iHAXc1Q)

The perspective shifts to an aerial view and [[Skar]] looks down on him and the clan chief facing off, the book between them. 

[[Skar]] feels an irresistible pull and he falls towards the open pages of the book which slams shut around him. Everything goes dark and silent. 

When [[Skar]]’s senses return, he hears the soft rustling of vellum pages around him and he looks at a ceiling whose beams are decorated with carvings of lion heads.

He feels like he is laying on his back. Like a book which has just been opened. As he tries to get up, everything around him starts spinning and he feels like something holds him back, binds him, chains him.

Again, the perspective shifts and he feels like he is getting closer to the source of the visions. 

Eventually the below visual comes into focus and the chained angelic figure is being identified as [[Shemhazai]], [[Shemhazai|The Outcast]], an [[Empyreal Lord]], who - if the tales are to be believed - has been captured by [[Lamashtu]].

Finally, the figure transforms into an enormous floating citadel, chained to the inside of a volcano by 5 massive chains.

## [[Trinica]]'s Vision

It starts with the below, which is quickly identified as a common symbol of [[Ylimancha]], [[Ylimancha|The Harborwing]], an [[Empyreal Lord]]. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MiDLhHSOZr95ujynbOnzHRVcGK89P4Ydr7vtFOaDoQALq1TxrW7rseU8lE-oegudLgskc5l6OzJIM0oT7-HFTOpMByrBzTEnnmOpk-ddfRA1axEiayPHmw8jaIXvZvpwAZHi6TVr08ou2aMCuijWFQ)

You see a battle between an osprey-headed woman carrying a teak longbow strung with gold and this creature, which is quickly identified as the demon lord [[Pazuzu]]. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tyZEsdeB0qA_7Z-O86uFrgVKqK47O5L_8LjkADYelj4Xc0k3i1PeeSP3D_rFdFFQO69WHno0VzWTgkFYYvSkS9oG7Yyuz9qlPtssRlrusCdqk7aYr-VCkPa9V-QQMBgROpezoNJyWjLM2iDg-6Tpzg)

The flurry of wings of the two creatures turn into two books which fly away. Following the first book, you see a wild coast flying by below you. You recognize passing by the [[Old Light ]]in [[Sandpoint]], rapidly moving north, eventually disappearing into the tower of a well-maintained castle. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Iu6Wdie_v1mOgqHkjboLkkZb-5yZfgZxJ6xXrKSVY2mBlw8XuoUigajejOHZrc9yq90fkK5u-LPtAleRBITSWyCRXGW7rBp_iOPImcojJVNXnMBy6zxkor45zgr4_gbsKKcNSzaDgMWsEl4d9bKM5w)

You see it settling on a different wall of that library though: 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5l84yH1KN3cZ5ftBbcFYCVH1UX7Ahd2iIKFIlhBem-Hu8OynAQ9eNGgKWQqGfZaYXLTQdkr3kGHX3q7gNsRvcnVdE0biAmr0SKtjk_a-QSyuzOat_TZ54aHtS2gd2EFg43O0Z7ERtve5VxFe66Lo5w)

You decide to open the door in that wall and find yourself flying inland and you recognize you are heading east as you fly across the [[Storval Rise]], heading for an ominous looking black tower. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Qui3zOWqBRwnY4hCWdaerlBdFCxq_F77acZds2QCZfVxydrlgj3JoCoZ7rTJB95xxg4fzN-PithiFeflFSauHb8xkSBz0LseasG-CxnonT-94q1GKubq1YqcP6zv63N1vR4Gz7cv7M_wEfhXju-jqg)

The book is greeted by an enigmatic apparition. Historic knowledge identifies it as the mysterious [[Black Monk]], guardian of the Black Tower. Rumor have it that both the tower and the monk predated even the arrivals of Xin and the Azlanti at the beginning of the [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] Empire. 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/1fL9gask6__Rs9kx5pG5PyFBFw3T7TKeLlywsht4hUyo2luglpGXFfpBWV3sy2pik206TgUzv-SoqKXCFkQyHLqZsjJCCbgc8DUcHg0_r85iOaF2vPWQ4gM8rZ1gCZb1lvBUBTwQcw-AD0dd_cNzRg)

The book ends up on a shelf in here 

![Image](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/r7P5A0BPWJQe8tc9ul0HYUPKjYpG7GyWHS7n4XgYYG2lNgCS33l3mWlLMs0dL_NZ49ltPUHwcGn-lzkqHkK5rrWc4nzSBlZxDmF2-uA0N-dogiG6gCFT-Lo7KBq1_qd9k6HiN5pvJg_n_l-plqR7sg)

## [[Mina]]’s Vision

The chamber brings her back to the night of her coming of age ceremony on [[Chopper's Island]]. 

Events proceed as she remembers, but when she steps to the edge of the cliff briefly before the moment when the lightning struck, time seems to slow down to a crawl. She sees the lightning inching down from the sky closing in on her.  

But she also notices something else. As her eyes wander down from [[Mina]]’s head to her feet she sees tendrils of writhing darkness emerging from the ground. 

Both the lightning bolt and the tendrils are approaching [[Mina]], whose body is silhouetted against the moon. And connect with her at the same time.

Everything turns black.

Then the night sky returns and she sees a dark-haired [[Vistani]] woman, with a wreath of moss crowning her curly hair fighting off a host of evil winged creatures, all of them with four wings (conflict between [[Ashava]] and [[Pazuzu]])

The image blurs and she sees a figure emerging from the dark. Seemingly standing in front of a strange wall apparently made of books. She can hear the flapping of wings and paper rustling in the breeze. The creature opens her mouth. And not a single sound seems to come out. [[Mina]] feels unsure: is this creature friend or foe? But answers are beyond the door.
