About 50 years later in 1906, a light appeared in the abandoned Lord’s Tower. Marc ApBlanc, the great-grandsohn of the [[Young Minstrel]], a man of about 30 years, had laid claim to the heritage of the [[ApBlanc]] clan of [[Forfar]].

Papers showed that he was the grandson of [[Bragain ApBlanc]] (one of the sons of the [[Young Minstrel]]), who disappeared in 1839.

He added a grand hall and a guest tower and eventually walls, transforming the castle into a fortress, much to the distress of the still ruling [[ApFitch]] clan. They send a squad of soldiers up to the castle to halt the construction, but [[Marc ApBlanc]]’s men slaughtered them all and their blood ended up in the mortar. 

The [[ApFitch]]’s had little resources to put up against that and in 1920 [[Marc ApBlanc]] called for an end of their rule over [[Forfar]]. Civil war ensured years later the surviving members of the [[ApFitch]]’s were marched off to the dungeon of [[Castle ApBlanc]].
