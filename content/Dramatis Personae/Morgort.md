**The Knight of Warts!**

A [[Boggard]] guard in [[Downfall]] that joined with the [[Rungs Against the Seven]] as an aspirant [[Junior Rungs|Junior Rung]] after they rescued him. He was given a trinket by [[W_rm]] to both signify his place as an aspirant [[Junior Rungs|Junior Rung]] as well as provide a tie to hopefully keep them together. 

[[Morgort]] fought bravely in the battle against [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] alongside the [[Rungs Against the Seven]]! 

[[Morgort]] traveled through the Mirrior Portal from [[Hither]] to the [[Material Plane]] with the [[Rungs Against the Seven]]. With [[Bavlorna Blightstraw|Bavlorna]]'s magic waning he began to revert to a standard less-sentient [[Boggard]], but the [[Rungs Against the Seven|RATS]] are helping him keep hold of his identity: he is [[Morgort]] the Knight of Warts!!
