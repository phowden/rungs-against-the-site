Female Varki Ranger

Introduced to us by [[Kelda Oxgutter]] at a charter house of the [[White Estrid]] (Utforskare Huis). In the bathhouse...

She knows the guide who can help [[Ameiko]] across the [[Crown of the World]] but he's missing, declared dead.

[[Snorri Stone-Eye]] is a powerful thane, instrumental to intimidating guides into working with the guild (of guides?). He was healthy, but his mental competence was in question. Rumours are he was raiding, which is forbidden by the [[White Estrid]].

She asked us to help her after realizing we're looking for a guide. She needs us to rescue [[Ulf Gormundr]]. She suspects he was captured and put on a funeral barge to punish him for refusing to join the guild.
