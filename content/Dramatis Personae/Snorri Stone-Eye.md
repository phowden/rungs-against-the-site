A powerful thane, instrumental to intimidating guides into working with the guild (of guides?). He was healthy, but his mental competence was in question. Rumours are he was raiding, which is forbidden by the [[White Estrid]].

Captured [[Ulf Gormundr]] and imprisoned him in a funeral barge as punishment for resisting joining the guild.
