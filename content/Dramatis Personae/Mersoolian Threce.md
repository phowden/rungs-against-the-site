[[Sandpoint]] scholar of [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] history

Gave the [[Rungs Against the Seven|RATS]] sketches that he found in [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruins

He went crazy at the excavation point of the site of a [[Thassilon|Thassilonian]] ruin related to the [[Runelord]] of Greed. 

They found his notes in the ruins below the excavation point, relating to a "tower" that could be the seat of power of the [[Runelord]] of greed: the [[Eye of Avarice]]
