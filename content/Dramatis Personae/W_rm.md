# Changes from Journey to the [[First World]]
### See-Through Eyes
Traded [[Trinket, Bauble, and Charm]] his "eye color" which caused the iris of his eyes to become transparent. In exchange [[W_rm]] received the "Very Good Thimble" (fingertip not included) to keep.
## Hunger & Thirst
Traded [[Trinket, Bauble, and Charm]] his eye color, and gained immunity to taste cravings (food/drink based compulsion) by giving away his memory of his favorite food. 
- Manifests as being completely unable to predict/manage hunger or thirst
	- Thirsty all the time, but can't explain the phenomena
	- Losing weight, has to be told to eat/drink
	- Doesn't care about drinking booze
## Drawings from a [[Deck of Many Things]]
Drew three cards from a [[Deck of Many Things]] ([[Harrow Deck|Harrow Cards]]) with [[Bauble]]:
- **Talons**: all magical items disappear
- **Fates**: avoid any situation, once
- **Balance**: become `lawful neutral`
Used the **Fates** card to trade items with his past self, using *Ally Across Time*.
- The `lawful neutral` change manifests in an obsession with the ordering of the "cosmic deck"
	- His [[Harrow Deck]] is always in the order he needs, no more shuffling
	- He's pursuing research into topics that will give him insight into the ordering

## [[Empyreal Lord|Empyreal]] Powers

> You feel a surge of power flowing through you as [[Shyka, the Many|Shyka]] extends their benevolent consciousness to you.  
> 
> And it is clear to you that this power will distinguish you from mere mortal heroes from hence on. With untainted clarity you understand that you have been infused with the following abilities, to be used as you see fit, never to be taken away from you.  
### Hard to kill (Ex) 
Whenever you're below 0 hit points, **you automatically stabilize** without needing to attempt a Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points when below 0 hit points. In addition, **you don't die until** your total number of negative hit points is equal to or greater than **double your Constitution score**.  
### [[Empyreal Lord|Empyreal]] Power (5/day)
You can call upon your empyreal power to overcome difficult challenges. **You can expend one use of empyreal power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result**. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll.  
### Hit Point Gain
Your current and maximum HP increase by 3.  
### Wild Arcana (Ex)
As a standard action, you can **expend one use of Empyreal Power to cast any one arcane spell without expending a prepared spell or spell slot**. The spell must be on one of your arcane class spell lists, must be of a level that you can cast with that arcane spellcasting class, and **must have a casting time of "1 standard action" (or less)**. You don't need to have the spell prepared, nor does it need to be on your list of spells known. When casting a spell in this way, you treat your **caster level as 2 levels higher** for the Purpose of any effect dependent on level. You can apply any metamagic feats you know to this spell, but its to total adjusted level can't be greater than that of the highest-level arcane spell you can cast from that spellcasting class.
### Empyreal Point Blank Shot (Ex)
+2 on attack and damage in Point Blank range  
### Empyreal Dispel (Su)
When using *Dispel Magic* as a targeted dispel, **this spell can end two spells affecting the target** instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you **heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level** of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this healing applies only to the highest level spell dispelled. **If you use this spell to counterspell, roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result**.

#### Rumors

Some more details Worm has picked up since his arrival in [[Sandpoint]]: On the nights when he doesn’t make it past the bouncers in the more respectable taverns and gambling places in town (the Hagfish) where Skar is the bouncer, he ends up fleecing patrons at the _Fatman's Feedbag_. _Gressel Tenniwar_, the tavern keeper there, doesn't seem to care and even smirked once or twice during one of Worm's "performances". However, Worm has overheard folks murmuring that Gressel is not the true owner, but just a front.

During one of his lucky streaks, one of the other players who lost to him, glowered at him and said something under his breath, which sounded like "The Bunyip Club will get you soon enough, cheater."
