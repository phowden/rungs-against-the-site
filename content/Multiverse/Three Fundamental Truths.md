Three fundamental principles governing the multiverse

- The [[Rule of Three]]
	- Everything occurs in threes
- [[Unity of Rings]]
	- Things are circular, happen in rings, connect back to themselves
- [[Center of All]]
	- states that there is a center of everything — or, rather, wherever a person happens to be is the center of the multiverse
