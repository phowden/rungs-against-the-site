Also known as the House of the Twenty Faiths 

## History
Windsong Abbey was built in 4081/82 AR as a pacifist refuge for followers of all religions—good and evil—to come and resolve their doctrinal and political differences in a non-violent manner and to peacefully further their own goals.

Following [[Aroden]]’s death in 4606 the congregation began to fall apart, but is still receiving visitors and the lighthouse is a fixture for seafaring people on their way North. It is rumored that the Priest of Pharasma lost his mind (like so many) and started infighting in the Abbey 

The building itself is quite dramatic, with countless arches and towers, tall stained glass windows which refract the light, and special tunnels in the walls and floors which produce sounds very like a pipe organ. All this is set against the dramatic cliffs and foam-flecked waters of the [[Varisia|Varisian]] Gulf. It is rumoured that the abbey was built on top of a much older temple.

The abbey is run by a woman known only as the Masked Abbess. Most notable feature is the 150ft tall Parus Pharasmae, a light house built from white marble.

## [[Windsong Testaments]]
The combined capabilities of the faithful allowed them to gain unique insights into mysteries of creation and concepts. Some of them were made accessible to visitors and became known as the [[Windsong Testaments]], each of them called a [[Windsong Testaments|Codicil]].

Six codicils are known to the world outside of Windsong Abbey 
- Codicil One: Rage of Creation
- Codicil Two: Time’s Price
- Codicil Three: The Three Fears of Pharasma
- Codicil Four: The Acts of Iomedae
- Codicil Five: On Family Bonds
- Codicil Six: The Beauty of Horrors

It is rumored that some of the codices – known or unknown - have been gifted to leaders in Golarion to guide them.
