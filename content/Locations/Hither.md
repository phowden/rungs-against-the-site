Portion of [[Prismere]] that belonged to [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] after the [[Hourglass Coven]] divided it amongst themselves after trapping [[Zybilna]]. Accompanying realm to [[Thither]] and [[Yon]].

A massive swamp. 

It is a foreboding place, one where daylight never fully penetrates the dank mist that hangs over the land, and where cruel and mischievous bandits prey upon stranded and lost travelers. Hither is the realm of the present, where life and decay walk hand in hand, and where creatures live in the moment, not concerned with history or repercussions.

[[Hither]]'s fetid waters rise and fall sporadically. In minutes, neck-deep murk might recede to reveal a soggy landscape of squelching mud and skeletal mangrove roots, but only until the waters ooze back into the swamp to fill it once again in an hour or three. The ebb and flow have a supernatural origin: Hither is dotted with ancient stone wells, known as o'-wells, which drink up and spew out the swamp water

The [[Rungs Against the Seven]] entered [[Hither]] through the cave of the [[Vit Hexa]] under [[Halgrim]]. They traveled through [[Hither]] searching for [[Bavlorna Blightstraw|Bavlorna]]. They found her in [[Downfall]] and defeated her.

After the death of [[Bavlorna Blightstraw|Bavlorna]], Hither began to purify. The fetid waters cleared, the rotting flora were restored.
