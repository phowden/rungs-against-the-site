Seat of power of the [[Runelord]] of Greed, [[Karzoug]]

[[Mersoolian Threce]] left behind a sketch of the tower, with notes of him trying to figure out the details of the sketch. 

# Keys to the [[Eye of Avarice]]
- The [[Rungs Against the Seven]] have been collecting pieces to a set of 3 keys (unknowingly at first)
- The letter from [[Skabatha Nightshade]] to [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] revealed that the keys are to the [[Eye of Avarice]]
	- [[Hourglass Coven#Letter from Skabatha Nightshade to Bavlorna Blightstraw]]
	- She mentions them "needing to get the keys" to the [[Rungs Against the Seven]]
		- but for unknown reasons as of [[2023-10-Oct-21]]

# Notes of [[Mersoolian Threce]]
- "By [[Nethys]], is this really all I can glean of where that Tear of Tiamat is?"
- "It seems as if a veil is shielding it"
- "Does that shape look familiar after all?"
- "Maybe I didn't get the _Scrying_ spell right after all. As much as it is above my other magic"
- "Or maybe the orb has been moved and I am only seeing the destination of this local _Teleport_"
