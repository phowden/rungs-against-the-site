The seat of the clan [[ApBlanc]], rulers of ancient [[Forfar]]

The first building was the Lord's Tower 

[[Marc ApBlanc]] added a grand hall and a guest tower and eventually walls, transforming the castle into a fortress, much to the distress of the still ruling [[ApFitch]] clan. They sent a squad of soldiers up to the castle to halt the construction, but [[Marc ApBlanc]]â€™s men slaughtered them all and their **blood ended up in the mortar**.
