Letter from [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]] to his son [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]]

# Transcription
>My son, my heir
>You know now that I have kept secrets from you. You were always a perceptive son and you may not undestand my reasons for secrecy. I hope that you realize it's necessary. Know that I was not angry with you for opening the [[Warding Box]] - I was angry with myself for witholding the truth from you and forcing you to seek out what I should have given to you. The words I spoke to you were from anger with myself and it shames me to think of them now. I write this note as an apology and to beg you to leave those secrets to history.
>
>The next few days will be the most important I have face in many years. If our family's enemies have, as I hope, forgotten us I shall reunite with you and your wife and your mother and I shall reveal the truth to you. But if they still seek the contents of the [[Warding Box]], I fear that I may not speak to you again. The box holds our family's greatest treasure, so I have returned it to [[Kartun]]'s care. And it shall remain hidden in the secret third vault under [[Brinewall Castle]] - obscured from our enemies I hope and pray. I will not grant our foes the satisfaction of killing me themselves - if it comes to it, let my death by my own hand be my final act to protect you, so that our enemies elieve our line ended.
>
>I have instruct [[Tsutama]] to keep this letter from you, delivering it to you only should I fail to return as I hope to. If I can I will reveal all to you myself. If I cannot, this final missive from a father to a  son must suffice as an apology in place of an explanation and you must destroy this letter, flee to the south, and never return to [[Brinewall Castle]]. If our enemies find what I hav ehidden there will be nothing here for you. If they do not, they will lie in wait forever for your return.
>
>I hope to see you again soon my son, but my heart tells me I will not. I am sorry to have failed you, but I am proud of you, and I know you will survive this old man's shame. You are strong, and you must remain so. For if you are reading this and I am gone, know that our enemies will never stop searching for us, and that is why I cannot reveal the truth to you until I know there is a chance of them finding us again.
