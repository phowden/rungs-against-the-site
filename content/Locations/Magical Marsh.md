The [[Rungs Against the Seven]] were magically transported to this extra-dimensional space multiple times while adventuring in [[Brinestump Marsh]]

Fought multiple [[Will o Wisps]], [[Corpse Candles]], [[Stirges]]

Found coins from [[Forfar]] with the [[ApBlanc]] crest
Found a stone sword with the crest of [[ApFitch]]
Found a writ in one of the urns proclaimed the coins as property of the [[Lord of Forlorn]]


Detected the influence of [[Shyka, the Many]] in the marsh as well as a statue to her

Encountered the ghost of [[Isolt ApBlanc]], which gave [[W_rm]] a vision of the funeral of one of his brothers in [[Forfar]]

The [[Rungs Against the Seven|RATS]] were pulled from the [[Magical Marsh]] back to [[Brinestump Marsh]], possibly through the interference of a [[Bythos]]
