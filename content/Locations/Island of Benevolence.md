Pool of water the [[Rungs Against the Seven]] encountered in the [[Magical Marsh]]

They found the sarcophagus of [[Isolt ApBlanc]], along with the ghost of [[W_rm]]'s mother!

The ghost spoke to [[W_rm]] and said: 
- "Me son, didn't think to see you on this side"
- "Did you bring the key of passage through the mists"
- "The hope of [[Forfar]] rides on you"
