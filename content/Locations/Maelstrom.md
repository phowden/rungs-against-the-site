A swirling dark expanse, with elements of the [[Astral Sea]] and the [[Ethereal Plane]]. A lone platform surrounded by statues, one with it's head crumbled to nothing. A clock surrounded by chains: ticking, ticking, ticking. Stairs leading up to the clock are coated in viscera. 

The [[Rungs Against the Seven]] ended up here after defeating [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]. Her death caused the realm of [[Hither]] to collapse in upon itself. This left only that which is behind reality, the [[Maelstrom]]. 

Here they witnessed the [[Steward of Stethalos]], warden of [[Stethalos]] in the [[Dimension of Time]]. Possibly the [[Maelstrom]] is in the [[Dimension of Time]]?

The platform they stood upon was [[The Seal]]!!!
